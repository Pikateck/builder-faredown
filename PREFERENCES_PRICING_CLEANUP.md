# Preferences Step: Pricing Removed ✅

## Summary
The Preferences step in the booking flow has been redesigned to focus on **pure guest preferences** without any pricing. All add-on charges have been removed.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Pricing Elements**
- ❌ Removed "Additional Services" section with pricing
- ❌ Removed ₹50 (Early Check-in) price tag
- ❌ Removed ₹30 (Late Check-out) price tag
- ❌ Removed `addOnPricing` object and `calculateAddOns()` function

### 2. **Redesigned UI for Pure Preferences**

#### Room Preferences Section
- Clean dropdown selectors (no pricing)
- **Bed Type**: King Bed, Queen Bed, Twin Beds
- **Smoking Preference**: Non-Smoking, Smoking
- **Floor Preference**: High Floor, Low Floor, Mid Floor, Quiet Area

#### Guest Requests Section
Checkbox items without any pricing:
- **Early Check-in**: Request check-in before 3:00 PM
- **Late Check-out**: Request check-out after 12:00 PM
- **Daily Housekeeping**: Request room cleaning during stay

### 3. **Updated Pricing Logic**
```typescript
// BEFORE
const grandTotal = pricing.total + calculateAddOns();

// AFTER
const grandTotal = pricing.total;
// Preferences are guest requests without additional charges
```

### 4. **Cleaned Summary Display**
- Removed "Add-on Services" line from booking summary
- Summary now only shows:
  - Room Rate (base price)
  - Taxes & Fees
  - **Total Price (incl. taxes)** ← This is the final amount

## Design Principles Applied

✅ **Clean & Simple**: Checkboxes and dropdowns without pricing labels
✅ **No Currency**: Zero price references in the preferences UI
✅ **Aligned Theme**: Matches the overall booking flow aesthetic
✅ **User-Friendly**: Added informational banner explaining that preferences are accommodation requests
✅ **Responsive**: Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop

## Price Summary Panel (Right Side)
The right-side summary panel already shows:
- Room Rate breakdown
- Taxes & Fees
- **Total Price (incl. taxes)** in large, bold text

Preferences no longer affect the final price—they're purely for guest accommodation requests.

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate to Step 2 (Preferences)
- [ ] Verify no pricing labels appear
- [ ] Select various preferences (bed type, floor, guest requests)
- [ ] Confirm final total in summary doesn't change with preference selection
- [ ] Test on mobile viewport (375px, 480px)
- [ ] Test on desktop viewport (1024px+)

## File Modified
- `client/pages/ReservationPage.tsx`
  - Removed pricing UI from Preferences step
  - Removed add-on pricing logic
  - Updated grand total calculation
  - Cleaned summary display

## Result
The Preferences step is now a clean, focused UI for guest stay preferences without any pricing confusion. The Price Summary panel remains the single source of truth for all costs.
