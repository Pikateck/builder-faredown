# Booking Confirmation & Voucher Fixes ✅

## Summary
Fixed critical data continuity issues where special requests and room preferences were lost after the Preferences page. All booking data now flows through the entire booking lifecycle: Search → Details → Preferences → Review → Confirmation → Voucher.

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Data Continuity** (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: Special Requests and Room Preferences selected on Preferences page were not being passed to Confirmation or Voucher
**Solution**:
- Updated `ReservationPage.tsx` to save preferences and pricing in `bookingData` before saving to localStorage
- Updated `HotelBookingConfirmation.tsx` to read and display saved booking data
- Updated `BookingVoucher.tsx` to read and display saved booking data

### 2. **Missing Preferences Display** (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: Confirmation and Voucher showed hardcoded preferences, not user selections
**Solution**:
- Added "Room Preferences & Guest Requests" section in Confirmation page
- Added "Room Preferences & Guest Requests" section in Voucher
- Displays:
  - ✓ Bed Type (King, Queen, Twin)
  - ✓ Smoking Preference (Smoking / Non-Smoking)
  - ✓ Floor Preference (High, Low, Mid, Quiet)
  - ✓ Guest Requests (Early Check-in, Late Check-out, Daily Housekeeping)

### 3. **Payment Details / Invoice** (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**:
- "Original Price: ₹0" displayed incorrectly
- No proper invoice breakdown
- Missing discount information

**Solution**:
- Updated pricing display to show:
  - ✓ Base Room Rate (with nights multiplier)
  - ✓ Taxes & Fees
  - ✓ Discounts (shown in green with minus sign)
  - ✓ Net Payable (final amount in large, bold green)
  - ✓ Payment Mode and Status
- Removed incorrect "Original Price ₹0" fields
- Added proper "Net Payable" label for final amount

### 4. **Hotel Voucher Data** (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: Voucher used hardcoded mock data instead of actual booking data
**Solution**:
- Voucher now reads actual booking data from localStorage
- Displays all required fields:
  - ✓ Guest name
  - ✓ Check-in/check-out dates with times
  - ✓ Room type and preferences
  - ✓ Hotel address and contact info
  - ✓ Booking reference number
  - ✓ Special requests and room preferences
  - ✓ Total paid amount with breakdown
  - ✓ Payment mode and status
  - ✓ Cancellation policy
  - ✓ Hotel amenities
  - ✓ Important policies
