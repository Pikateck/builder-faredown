# Flight Calendar Terminology Update - COMPLETED

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED CHANGES

### Problem Statement:

Flight calendars were showing "Check-in" and "Check-out" labels, which are hotel terminology. Flight calendars should show "Departure" and "Arrival" instead.

### Solution Implemented:

#### 1. BookingCalendar Component Enhancement ✅

**File**: `client/components/BookingCalendar.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Added conditional labels based on `bookingType` prop
- **Flight calendars**: Show "DEPARTURE" and "ARRIVAL"
- **Hotel calendars**: Show "CHECK-IN" and "CHECK-OUT"
- Hide "NIGHTS" counter for flight bookings (only show for hotels)

```typescript
// Labels now conditional:
{bookingType === "flight" ? "DEPARTURE" : "CHECK-IN"}
{bookingType === "flight" ? "ARRIVAL" : "CHECK-OUT"}

// Nights display only for hotels:
{bookingType === "hotel" && dateInfo.nights > 0 && (...)}
```

#### 2. Flight Pages Updated ✅

**FlightResults.tsx**:

- Added `bookingType="flight"` prop to BookingCalendar
- Calendar now shows "DEPARTURE" and "ARRIVAL" labels

**Index.tsx** (Homepage):

- Added `bookingType="flight"` prop to BookingCalendar
- Calendar now shows "DEPARTURE" and "ARRIVAL" labels

**MobileDropdowns.tsx**:

- Already had `bookingType="flight"` properly set
- Mobile flight date picker correctly uses flight terminology

#### 3. Hotel Calendars Unchanged ✅

**BookingSearchForm.tsx**:

- Uses default `bookingType="hotel"`
- Maintains "CHECK-IN" and "CHECK-OUT" labels
- Shows "NIGHTS" counter correctly

### Current Status:

#### ✅ Flight Calendars Now Show:

- **DEPARTURE** (instead of CHECK-IN)
- **ARRIVAL** (instead of CHECK-OUT)
- No "NIGHTS" counter (not applicable)

#### ✅ Hotel Calendars Still Show:

- **CHECK-IN**
- **CHECK-OUT**
- **NIGHTS** counter

### Implementation Details:

#### Conditional Logic:

```typescript
interface BookingCalendarProps {
  bookingType?: "hotel" | "flight";
}

// Default to hotel for backward compatibility
bookingType = "hotel"

// Labels are now context-aware:
<div className="text-xs text-gray-600 font-medium">
  {bookingType === "flight" ? "DEPARTURE" : "CHECK-IN"}
</div>
```

#### Files Modified:

1. `client/components/BookingCalendar.tsx` - Core logic update
2. `client/pages/FlightResults.tsx` - Added flight prop
3. `client/pages/Index.tsx` - Added flight prop
4. `client/components/MobileDropdowns.tsx` - Already correct

#### Files Unchanged (Correct as-is):

1. `client/components/BookingSearchForm.tsx` - Hotel bookings
2. Other hotel-related calendar usages

### User Experience Impact:

#### Before:

- Flight calendars: "CHECK-IN" → "CHECK-OUT" ❌
- Hotel calendars: "CHECK-IN" → "CHECK-OUT" ✅

#### After:

- Flight calendars: "DEPARTURE" → "ARRIVAL" ✅
- Hotel calendars: "CHECK-IN" → "CHECK-OUT" ✅

### Note on Airport Check-in References:

References to "Check-in" in flight results (baggage check-in, airport check-in procedures) remain unchanged as they are correct aviation terminology, not calendar labels.
