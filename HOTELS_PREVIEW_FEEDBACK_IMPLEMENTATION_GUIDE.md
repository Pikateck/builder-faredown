## ISSUE #1: Top Search Bar Shows Blank (Results & Details)

### Problem
- HotelSearchForm component starts with blank state (lines 59-80 in HotelSearchForm.tsx)
- HotelResults already parses URL params (lines 128-133)
- But form is rendered without hydration props
- Creates blank/placeholder state on both /hotels/results and /hotels/:slug

### Solution
1. **Modify HotelSearchForm component:**
   - Add props interface for initial values: destination, destinationCode, checkInDate, checkOutDate, guests
   - Add useEffect to hydrate from props when provided
   - Use controlled inputs with initial values from props

2. **Modify HotelResults.tsx (line 1833):**
   - Pass URL params to HotelSearchForm:
   ```tsx
   <HotelSearchForm 
     initialDestination={destination}
     initialCheckIn={checkIn}
     initialCheckOut={checkOut}
     initialGuests={{ 
       adults: parseInt(adults), 
       children: parseInt(children), 
       rooms: parseInt(rooms) 
     }}
   />
   ```

3. **Modify HotelDetails.tsx:**
   - Same approach - pass URL params (or get from location.state) to HotelSearchForm
   - Ensure top bar shows same criteria as results page

### Files to Edit
- `client/components/HotelSearchForm.tsx`: Add props, hydration logic
- `client/pages/HotelResults.tsx`: Pass props at line 1833
- `client/pages/HotelDetails.tsx`: Add HotelSearchForm with props

### AC
- [ ] Results page top bar always shows: destination, check-in/out, guests/rooms (never blank)
- [ ] Details page top bar always shows same criteria (never blank)
- [ ] No flashing/placeholder state on mount

## ISSUE #2: Hotel Card Content Too Sparse

### Problem
- Cards lack important info: full address, room features, policy status
- Need Booking.com-style density

### Solution
Add to HotelCard.tsx in all views (grid, mobile, desktop):

1. **Location line (under hotel name):**
   - Already exists but may need visibility improvement
   - Format: "Al Barsha, Dubai · 14 km from downtown"

2. **Policy chips (between amenities and price):**
   - Show only when applicable:
     - "Free cancellation" (if hotel.freeCancellation)
     - "Pay at property" (if hotel.payAtProperty)
   - Use badge/chip styling (small, inline)

3. **Room features summary (2-3 key features):**
   - Extract from hotel.roomTypes[0] or hotel.availableRoom
   - Format: "Standard room · Free WiFi · 1 king bed"
   - Use gray text, smaller font

4. **Layout order:**
   - Image
   - Stars rating (next to name)
   - Hotel name
   - Location line
   - Amenity icons (3-4 max)
   - Policy chips (Free cancellation, Pay at property)
   - Room features summary
   - Price (bottom-right)
   - "View Details" button

### Files to Edit
- `client/components/HotelCard.tsx`: Add location verification, policy chips, room features in all 3 views

### AC
- [ ] Location line visible under hotel name in grid, mobile, desktop
- [ ] Policy chips render (Free cancellation, Pay at property)
- [ ] Room features shown (2-3 bullets)
- [ ] All info fits in card, no overflow

---

## ISSUE #3: Stars & Reviews Styling

### Problem
- Star icons and review counts not properly aligned
- Booking.com reference shows: stars next to name, reviews badge on right

### Solution
1. **Layout (in hotel card header):**
   ```
   [★★★★ 4.5] Hotel Name  ...  8.5 · 3,210 reviews
   ```

2. **Star icons:**
   - Place next to or slightly before hotel name
   - Use 4-5 stars based on rating
   - Size: w-4 h-4 or similar

3. **Review badge (right side):**
   - Format: "8.5 · 3,210 reviews"
   - Larger font than stars
   - Align to top-right of card header
   - Clickable → goes to reviews section

### Files to Edit
- `client/components/HotelCard.tsx`: Restructure header with stars + reviews badge

### AC
- [ ] Stars visible next to or before hotel name
- [ ] Review score and count on right side
- [ ] All readable on mobile (responsive)
- [ ] Alignment consistent across grid/list/mobile views

## ISSUE #4: Search Bar Blank After Navigation to Details

### Root Cause
Same as Issue #1 - HotelSearchForm not hydrated on details page

### Solution
Apply same fix as Issue #1 to HotelDetails.tsx:
1. Get search params from URL or location.state
2. Pass to HotelSearchForm component
3. Ensure immediate hydration on mount

### Files to Edit
- `client/pages/HotelDetails.tsx`: Add HotelSearchForm with URL params

### AC
- [ ] No blank/placeholder state on details top bar after navigation
- [ ] Search criteria always visible and matches results page

---

## ISSUE #5: Mobile Room Cards - Duplicate Actions & Clipping

### Problem
- Per-room "Bargain" and "View Reviews" buttons redundant (already in bottom dock)
- Bottom dock buttons clipped on iPhone SE/12/13 widths
- safe-area-inset-bottom padding not applied

### Solution
1. **Remove from room cards:**
   - Find component that renders room cards in mobile details view
   - Remove Bargain and View Reviews buttons
   - Keep only "Select" button

2. **Fix dock clipping:**
   - Add `paddingBottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` to dock container
   - Ensure parent has `overflow: visible` (not `overflow: hidden`)
   - Test on iPhone SE width (375px) and iPhone 12 (390px)

3. **Button sizing:**
   - Buttons should use `.mobile-touch-target` or min-height 44px
   - Ensure full width or proper width on mobile

### Files to Edit
- `client/components/rooms/RoomCardMobile.tsx`: Remove Bargain/Reviews buttons
- Mobile details dock component: Add safe-area-inset-bottom padding

### AC
- [ ] Per-room cards show only "Select" button
- [ ] Bottom dock fully visible on iPhone SE/12/13 emulators
- [ ] No button clipping at bottom

## ISSUE #6: Bargain Chat Too Small / Conversation Not Visible

### Problem
- Modal height may be too small
- Messages area not properly scrollable
- Keyboard hides input/messages on mobile

### Solution
1. **Modal height:**
   - Set `minHeight: 85vh` (mobile)
   - Already at 100vh but may need tuning

2. **Messages area:**
   - Add `minHeight: 60vh`
   - Ensure `overflow-y: auto`
   - Make messages container flex-1 to fill available space

3. **Keyboard safety:**
   - Use `100dvh` (dynamic viewport height) where supported
   - Add `paddingBottom: calculateInputHeight() + safeAreaInset`
   - Or use viewport resize handler to adjust layout

4. **Visible messages:**
   - Ensure at least 5-6 messages visible without scrolling
   - Add auto-scroll to latest message
   - Test on mobile with keyboard open

### Files to Edit
- `client/components/ConversationalBargainModal.tsx`: Adjust heights, scroll, keyboard safety

### AC
- [ ] Mobile: 5-6 messages visible without scroll
- [ ] Keyboard does not cover input or last messages
- [ ] Auto-scroll to latest message works
- [ ] No console errors from async listeners
