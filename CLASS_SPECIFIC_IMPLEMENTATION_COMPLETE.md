## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Used

**Markup Rules Table:**
```sql
booking_class: economy | premium-economy | business | first
current_min_pct: 6-12% (varies by class)
current_max_pct: 10-18% (varies by class)
bargain_min_pct: 4-8% (varies by class)
bargain_max_pct: 8-15% (varies by class)
```

**Promo Codes Table:**
```sql
service_class: economy | premium-economy | business | first
discount_type: percent | fixed
discount_min: 5-12% (varies by class)
discount_max: 10-20% (varies by class)
```

### Normalization System

**File:** `client/lib/cabinClasses.ts`

```typescript
export type CabinClassValue = 
  | "economy" 
  | "premium-economy" 
  | "business" 
  | "first";

export const CABIN_CLASS_LABELS = {
  economy: "All – Economy Class",
  "premium-economy": "All – Premium Economy Class",
  business: "All – Business Class",
  first: "All – First Class",
};
```

### Fallback Data (When API Unavailable)

The frontend includes fallback sample data showing all 4 cabin class records, so even if the API is temporarily unavailable, you'll see the proper structure.

## 🎯 Business Logic Integration

### 1. Markup Application

When a flight search is performed:

```javascript
// System automatically selects the correct markup based on cabin class
const markup = findMarkupByClass(cabinClass);
// economy → Uses Mumbai-Dubai Economy Markup (15%)
// premium-economy → Uses Mumbai-Dubai Premium Economy Markup (12%)
// business → Uses Mumbai-Dubai Business Class Markup (10%)
// first → Uses Mumbai-Dubai First Class Markup (8%)
```

### 2. Current Fare Range (User-Visible Pricing)

Each class has different pricing volatility:

- **Economy:** 12% - 18% (wider range for competitive pricing)
- **Premium Economy:** 10% - 15% (moderate range)
- **Business:** 8% - 12% (narrower range, more stable)
- **First:** 6% - 10% (narrowest range, premium stability)

### 3. Bargain Fare Range (Acceptable Bargains)

Each class has different bargain thresholds:

- **Economy:** 8% - 15% (flexible bargaining)
- **Premium Economy:** 7% - 12% (moderate flexibility)
- **Business:** 5% - 10% (less flexible)
- **First:** 4% - 8% (least flexible, premium pricing)

### 4. Promo Code Application

Class-specific promo codes apply only to their respective classes:

- **FAREDOWN-ECO** → Only works on Economy flights
- **FAREDOWN-PE** → Only works on Premium Economy flights
- **FAREDOWN-BIZ** → Only works on Business flights
- **FAREDOWN-FIRST** → Only works on First flights

Markup Rule: Mumbai-Dubai Economy Markup (15%)
Random Markup: 14.5% (within 12%-18% Current Fare Range)
Displayed Price: ₹45,800
```

**Step 2: User Bargains**
```
User Offers: ₹42,000
Bargain Range: 8%-15% (₹43,200 - ₹46,000)

## 🚀 Seeding Scripts Created

### 1. Markup Seeding Script
**File:** `seed-class-specific-markups.cjs`

```bash
node seed-class-specific-markups.cjs
```

Creates 4 distinct markup records in `markup_rules` table.

### 2. Promo Code Seeding Script
**File:** `seed-class-specific-promos.cjs`

```bash
node seed-class-specific-promos.cjs
```

Creates 4 distinct promo codes in `promo_codes` table.

### 3. Re-seeding (If Needed)

Both scripts automatically:
- Delete existing records for the same route/codes
- Insert fresh records
- Verify insertion
- Display summary

**Safe to run multiple times!**

# Check markup records
node -e "
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({ 
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL, 
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } 
});
pool.query('SELECT rule_name, booking_class FROM markup_rules WHERE route_from=\\'BOM\\' AND route_to=\\'DXB\\' ORDER BY priority')
  .then(r => { console.log(r.rows); pool.end(); });
"

# Check promo codes
node -e "
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({ 
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL, 
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false } 
});
pool.query('SELECT code, service_class FROM promo_codes WHERE code LIKE \\'FAREDOWN-%\\' ORDER BY service_class')
  .then(r => { console.log(r.rows); pool.end(); });
"
```
