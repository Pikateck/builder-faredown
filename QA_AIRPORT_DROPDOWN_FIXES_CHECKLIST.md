## üß™ **Detailed Testing Instructions**

### **UI Behavior Tests**

1. **Desktop Multi-City Airport Selection**
   - Navigate to `/flights` and select "Multi-city"
   - Add a second flight leg
   - Change the second leg's destination from BOM to DXB
   - **Expected:** Label immediately shows "Dubai International" not "Rajiv Gandhi Shivaji International"

2. **Mobile Airport Selection**
   - Test on mobile browser or native app
   - Open flight search form
   - Select different airports for From/To fields
   - **Expected:** Selected airport names display correctly and persist

3. **Persistence Test**
   - Select airports, navigate away, then return
   - **Expected:** Previously selected airports remain visible

### **Validation Tests**

4. **Empty Field Validation**
   - Leave From or To field blank, attempt search
   - **Expected:** Inline error message, search blocked

5. **Same Airport Validation**
   - Set From and To to same airport (e.g., BOM ‚Üí BOM)
   - **Expected:** Error message, search blocked

6. **Date Validation**
   - Leave departure date blank, attempt search
   - **Expected:** Error message, search blocked

### **Data Flow Tests**

7. **Console Logging**
   - Open browser dev tools ‚Üí Console tab
   - Select airports and submit search
   - **Expected:** Logs show correct airport codes and names

8. **API Verification**
   - Use Postman collection: `Airport-Dropdown-Validation.postman_collection.json`
   - Run "Single Leg Flight Search - BOM to DXB" test
   - **Expected:** All tests pass, correct airport codes in API

### **Database Tests**

9. **Search Logging**
   - Perform a search, then run SQL:

   ```sql
   SELECT from_code, from_name, to_code, to_name
   FROM flight_search_logs
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```

   - **Expected:** Recent search appears with correct codes/names

10. **Validation Query**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM flight_search_logs WHERE from_code = to_code;
    ```

    - **Expected:** No results (same From/To should be blocked)

### **Cross-Platform Tests**

11. **Desktop Browsers**
    - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
    - **Expected:** Consistent behavior across browsers

12. **Mobile Browsers**
    - Test on mobile Chrome and Safari
    - **Expected:** Touch-friendly, no layout issues

13. **Native Apps**
    - Test on iOS and Android app builds
    - **Expected:** Same functionality as web

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

**PASS Requirements:**

- [ ] All UI checkpoints pass on web and mobile
- [ ] All validation rules prevent invalid searches
- [ ] Console logs show correct airport data
- [ ] Database logs contain accurate search records
- [ ] Postman tests pass without errors
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

---

## üßπ **Post-QA Cleanup**

After all tests pass:

1. **Remove Debug Logs**
   - Remove `console.log()` statements from:
     - `LandingPageSearchPanel.tsx`
     - `MobileNativeSearchForm.tsx`
     - `MobileFullScreenMultiCityInput.tsx`

2. **Database Logging** (Optional)
   - Consider disabling `flight_search_logs` in production
   - Or add feature flag to control logging
