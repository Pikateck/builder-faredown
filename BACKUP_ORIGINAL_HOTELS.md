# BACKUP POINT - Original Hotels Module

**Created:** Before echo-space hotel integration  
**Checkpoint ID:** cgen-138965ce51644bd09e8e42618161360d  
**Purpose:** Complete backup of original Hotels functionality for restore capability

## Original Files Backed Up:

- `client/pages/Hotels.tsx` - Original minimal placeholder hotel page
- All existing hotel routing and navigation

## Integration Plan:

1. Replace Hotels.tsx with echo-space Index.tsx (hotel landing page)
2. Add new hotel routes: /hotels/results, /hotels/:hotelId, /reserve, /booking-voucher, /booking-invoice
3. Create missing UI components referenced by echo-space components
4. Test complete hotel workflow

## Restore Instructions:

To restore original state, use checkpoint: `cgen-138965ce51644bd09e8e42618161360d`

## What Will NOT Be Changed:

- Header component and navigation structure
- Flights module (/flights routes)
- Any existing styling or design system
- Core application architecture

## What Will Be Added:

- Complete hotel search, results, details, booking, and payment flow
- AI-powered bargaining system
- Multi-currency support
- Payment integration with Razorpay
- Comprehensive hotel booking management

**Note:** All changes are additive and isolated to hotel functionality only.
