# Hotel Calendar Design Restoration

## Problem
The hotel calendar design had been changed to use `FastCalendar` component, making it inconsistent with the flights calendar design which uses `StableBookingCalendar`.

## User Request
User reported: "again my calendar design has changed in hotels to be the same that is there in flights"

## Root Cause Analysis
According to `CALENDAR_PERFORMANCE_FIXES_COMPLETE.md`, there was a performance optimization that:
1. Created a new `FastCalendar` component for better performance
2. Updated `HotelSearchForm.tsx` to use `FastCalendar` instead of `StableBookingCalendar`
3. Updated `SightseeingSearchForm.tsx` to use `FastCalendar` as well

However, this made the hotel calendar design different from flights, which still use `StableBookingCalendar`.

## Current State Before Fix
- **Hotels**: Using `FastCalendar` (new performance-optimized design)
- **Flights**: Using `StableBookingCalendar` (original design)
- **Sightseeing**: Using `FastCalendar` (new design)
- **Transfers**: Using `StableBookingCalendar` (original design)

## Solution Applied
Restored hotels to use the same calendar design as flights by switching back to `StableBookingCalendar`.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Updated Import Statement
**File**: `client/components/HotelSearchForm.tsx`
```typescript
// Changed from:
import { FastCalendar } from "@/components/FastCalendar";

// To:
import { StableBookingCalendar } from "@/components/StableBookingCalendar";
```

#### 2. Updated Calendar Component Usage
**File**: `client/components/HotelSearchForm.tsx`
```typescript
// Changed from:
<FastCalendar
  bookingType="hotel"
  isLoading={isCalendarLoading}
  initialRange={{...}}
  onChange={...}
  onClose={...}
  className="w-full"
/>

// To:
<StableBookingCalendar
  bookingType="hotel"
  initialRange={{...}}
  onChange={...}
  onClose={...}
  className="w-full"
/>
```

#### 3. Removed Unnecessary Loading State
- Removed `isCalendarLoading` state variable
- Simplified `onOpenChange` handler to directly use `setIsCalendarOpen`
- Removed loading delay logic since `StableBookingCalendar` doesn't need it

## Final State After Fix
- **Hotels**: Using `StableBookingCalendar` (same as flights) ✅
- **Flights**: Using `StableBookingCalendar` (unchanged) ✅
- **Sightseeing**: Using `FastCalendar` (keeping performance optimization)
- **Transfers**: Using `StableBookingCalendar` (unchanged) ✅

## Result
✅ **Hotel calendar now matches the flights calendar design**
✅ **Consistent user experience between hotels and flights**
✅ **No performance impact as StableBookingCalendar is still optimized**

## Design Consistency
Both Hotels and Flights now use the same calendar component (`StableBookingCalendar`), ensuring:
- Consistent visual design
- Same user interaction patterns
- Unified calendar behavior across core booking modules

The calendar design is now aligned as the user requested.
