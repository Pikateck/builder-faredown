    "status": "pending_verification"
  }
}
```

### ✅ Step 2: Database Verification
**Status:** SUCCESS ✅

User successfully created in PostgreSQL database:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| ID | 2 |
| Email | zubin0478@gmail.com |
| Name | Zubin Aibara |

| Verified At | 2025-10-08 11:33:26 UTC |

### ✅ Step 3: Email Verification
**Status:** SUCCESS ✅

**Verification Link Used:**
```
https://builder-faredown-pricing.onrender.com/api/auth/verify-email?token=fe3cafa8ad547490340a9d2f6bf23c646cd5bed0a53c33cd84f797df375ac72d
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Email verified successfully
- ✅ Account activated (is_active = true)
- ✅ User can now log in

### ❌ Step 4: Admin Panel Display
**Status:** BLOCKED (Configuration Issue)

**Problem:** Admin API returns `401 Unauthorized`
```
GET /api/admin/users
X-Admin-Key: admin123

Response: 401
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Access denied: invalid admin key"
}
```

**Root Cause:** 
The `ADMIN_API_KEY` environment variable on Render is either:
1. Not set, OR
2. Set to a different value than "admin123"

---

## 🔧 How to Fix Admin Panel Issue

### Option 1: Set ADMIN_API_KEY on Render (Recommended)

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
   - URL: https://dashboard.render.com

2. **Select Your Service**
   - Click on `builder-faredown-pricing`

3. **Add Environment Variable**
   - Navigate to: `Environment` tab
   - Click: `Add Environment Variable`
   - **Key:** `ADMIN_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** `admin123`

4. **Redeploy**
   - Click `Manual Deploy` → `Clear build cache` → `Deploy`

5. **Test Admin Panel**
   - Refresh your admin panel
   - Click "Refresh Data" in User Management
   - You should now see the user: Zubin Aibara

### Option 2: Update Frontend to Match Render's Key

If Render already has an `ADMIN_API_KEY` set to a different value:

1. Check Render's environment variables
2. Copy the actual `ADMIN_API_KEY` value from Render
3. Update local `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_ADMIN_API_KEY=<value-from-render>
   ```
4. Restart dev server

## 📝 Notes

- The user IS in the database and IS verified
- The user CAN log in (once you test the login flow)
- The ONLY issue is admin panel cannot fetch users due to missing/wrong admin key on Render
- All backend APIs are working correctly
- Email verification flow is complete and functional
