## How to Collect Evidence

### Method 1: Run Collection Script
```bash
cd api
node scripts/collect-evidence.js
```

### Method 2: Use API Endpoint (when deployed)
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/verify-users/verify
```

### Method 3: Manual SQL Queries
```sql
-- Users count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;

-- Recent bookings
SELECT * FROM hotel_bookings ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Payment stats
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM payments GROUP BY status;

-- Vouchers count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vouchers;
```

## Environment Variables Verified
