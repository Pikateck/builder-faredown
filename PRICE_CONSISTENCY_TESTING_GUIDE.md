## üìù NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS

1. **PriceSnapshot Lifecycle**:
   - Created at SEARCH stage (View Details click)
   - Locked at DETAILS stage (checksum verified)
   - Updated at BARGAIN stage (bargainApplied added)
   - Verified at BOOK stage (integrity check)
   - Confirmed at INVOICE stage (final display)

2. **Checksum is for**:
   - Detecting accidental price changes
   - Preventing stale data display
   - Tracking when bargain applied
   - NOT a payment security mechanism (use real crypto hashing in production)

3. **Currency Conversion**:
   - FX rate applied at createPriceSnapshot time
   - If currency changes: reset priceSnapshot, recalculate from scratch
   - Checksum recalculated with new FX rate

4. **Mock Data**:
   - priceCalculationService handles both live API and mock data
   - Same logic applies regardless of supplier
   - roomKey format: `{hotelId}-{roomId}` for uniqueness
