# QA Covering Email - Authentication Implementation

**To:** Builder QA Team  
**Subject:** URGENT: Authentication Flows QA Validation Required Before Production

---

## QA Assignment: Authentication Implementation Validation

The authentication flows for Bargain and Booking Payment have been completely redesigned to meet **global industry standards** (Booking.com/Airbnb/Expedia style).

### Critical Requirements:
- **ALL flows must use the same standard "Sign in to your account" popup**
- **Context preservation is mandatory** (guest details, search criteria, etc.)
- **Web + Mobile parity required** across all modules (Flights/Hotels/Sightseeing/Transfers)

### What You're Testing:
1. **Top Navigation** - Register/Sign In buttons trigger correct popups
2. **Bargain Flow** - Anonymous users get sign-in popup, then resume with context
3. **Booking Payment** - Login enforced ONLY at payment step, guest details preserved  
4. **Signed-in Users** - Direct access to all flows without interruption
5. **Edge Cases** - Session expiry, wrong credentials, popup cancellation

### Deliverable Required:
Please complete the attached **QA Confirmation Template** with Pass/Fail ticks for each test case.

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This template must be returned **fully completed and signed** before any production deployment.

### Testing URLs:
- **Web:** https://55e69d5755db4519a9295a29a1a55930-aaf2790235d34f3ab48afa56a.fly.dev
- **Mobile:** Same URL (responsive design)

### Expected Timeline:
- **QA Completion:** Within 2 business days
- **Template Return:** Immediately upon completion
- **Production Release:** Only after QA sign-off

### Questions/Issues:
Contact the development team immediately if any test case fails or if clarification is needed.

**This is the final validation step before production. All test cases must pass.**
