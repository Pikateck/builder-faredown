# üö® URGENT: Render CORS Configuration

## THE PROBLEM

The browser "Failed to fetch" error is caused by **CORS blocking on the Render backend**.

The code has the correct CORS patterns, but **Render hasn't deployed the updated CORS_ORIGIN environment variable**.

---

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE FIX (Required on Render Dashboard)

### Step 1: Verify CORS_ORIGIN on Render

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Open your `builder-faredown-pricing` service
3. Click **Environment** in left sidebar
4. Find `CORS_ORIGIN` variable

### Step 2: Ensure It Contains (comma-separated):

```
https://spontaneous-biscotti-da44bc.netlify.app,http://localhost:5173,https://55e69d5755db4519a9295a29a1a55930-aaf2790235d34f3ab48afa56a.fly.dev
```

**CRITICAL**: The fly.dev URL MUST be in there!

### Step 3: Manual Deploy

1. Click **Manual Deploy** dropdown (top right)
2. Select **Clear build cache & deploy**
3. Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment to complete

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

After deploy completes, test this URL:

```
https://builder-faredown-pricing.onrender.com/health
```

Should return JSON with status "healthy".

---

## Why This Happens

1. **Environment variables** on Render don't auto-apply to running services
2. **Deployment required** to pick up new environment variable values
3. **CORS check** happens before the browser even makes the request
4. If CORS fails, browser shows generic "Failed to fetch" (not specific CORS error)

---

## Verification

After Render redeploys, the admin panel will work immediately. No browser cache clearing needed.

Test by visiting:

```
https://55e69d5755db4519a9295a29a1a55930-aaf2790235d34f3ab48afa56a.fly.dev/admin/dashboard?module=users
```

Users should load without "Failed to fetch" error.

---

## Technical Proof

‚úÖ **CORS regex pattern** matches the fly.dev URL (verified)  
‚úÖ **Backend API** works (tested successfully)  
‚úÖ **Admin key** is correct (200 OK response)  
‚úÖ **CORS_ORIGIN** needs to be deployed on Render ‚ö†Ô∏è

The ONLY remaining issue is deploying the CORS_ORIGIN change on Render.
