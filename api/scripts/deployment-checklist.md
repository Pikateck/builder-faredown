```bash
# Copy alert rules to Prometheus
cp api/monitoring/prometheus-alerts.json /etc/prometheus/alerts/
systemctl reload prometheus
```

### 2. Grafana Dashboard Imported

- [ ] Dashboard shows: latency, cache hit rate, sessions/min, acceptance rate
- [ ] All panels loading data

## ðŸš© Feature Flags Configuration

### Shadow Mode (24h)

```bash
curl -X POST /api/admin/feature-flags \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"AI_SHADOW":true,"AI_TRAFFIC":0}'
```

- [ ] AI decisions logged but not served to users
- [ ] Control flow handles all traffic
- [ ] Decision accuracy and latency monitored

### 10% Canary (24h)

```bash
curl -X POST /api/admin/feature-flags \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"AI_SHADOW":false,"AI_TRAFFIC":0.1}'
```

- [ ] 10% users get AI bargaining
- [ ] 90% users get control experience
- [ ] Margin and acceptance rate monitored

### 50% Rollout (48h)

```bash
curl -X POST /api/admin/feature-flags \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"AI_TRAFFIC":0.5,"PROMO_SUGGESTIONS":true}'
```

- [ ] Promo Lab suggestions enabled
- [ ] Tier bonuses active
- [ ] User satisfaction tracked

### 100% Full Rollout

```bash
curl -X POST /api/admin/feature-flags \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"AI_TRAFFIC":1.0,"AI_FEATURES":"all"}'
```

- [ ] Auto-rollback triggers armed
- [ ] Full monitoring active

## ðŸ”„ Rollout Phases & Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Shadow (0% traffic, 24h)

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Zero errors in AI decision pipeline
- [ ] Latency p95 < 300ms consistently
- [ ] Decision accuracy > 85% vs expected
- [ ] No never-loss violations

**Rollback Triggers:**

- High error rate in decision pipeline
- Memory/CPU issues
- Database performance degradation

### Phase 2: 10% Canary (24h)

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Error rate < 0.5%
- [ ] Latency p95 < 300ms
- [ ] Margin drop vs control < 3%
- [ ] Acceptance rate > 15%

**Rollback Triggers:**

- Error rate > 1% for 5 minutes
- Latency p95 > 500ms for 5 minutes
- Margin drop > 5% for 1 hour

### Phase 3: 50% Rollout (48h)

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Error rate < 0.3%
- [ ] Latency p95 < 280ms
- [ ] Margin improvement > 2%
- [ ] User satisfaction > 4.2/5

**Rollback Triggers:**

- Same as 10% canary
- Customer complaints spike
- Booking conversion drops

### Phase 4: 100% Full (Ongoing)

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] All metrics stable
- [ ] Profit targets met
- [ ] Customer satisfaction maintained

**Auto-Rollback:**

- Margin drop > 3% vs control for 6h
- Error rate sustained > 0.5%

---

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Procedures

### Immediate Rollback

```bash
# Kill switch - disable all AI bargaining
curl -X POST /api/admin/feature-flags \
  -d '{"AI_KILL_SWITCH":true}'

# Or rollback to control
curl -X POST /api/admin/rollback \
  -d '{"reason":"emergency","percentage":0}'
```

### Rapid Fixes

#### If P95 spikes > 300ms:

1. Check Redis hit rate: `redis-cli info stats | grep keyspace`
2. Re-warm cache: `node api/scripts/cache-warmer.js`
3. Reduce action grid size: Update policy `max_actions_per_grid: 6`
4. Check batch model inference

#### If inventory flips spike > 2%:

1. Increase supplier refresh: `5min â†’ 3min` for hot SKUs
2. Check supplier API latency
3. Review rate limiting on supplier side

#### If profit margin drops:

1. Check Promo Lab for over-aggressive discounts
2. Lower `max_total_discount_pct` in Policy Manager
3. Review tier bonus configurations
4. Check for promo code abuse
