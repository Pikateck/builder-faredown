## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Shadow Mode (Week 1)
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"flag": "AI_TRAFFIC", "value": 0.0}' \
  $API_URL/api/feature-flags/set

curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"flag": "AI_SHADOW", "value": true}' \
  $API_URL/api/feature-flags/set
```
- **Goal**: Log all AI predictions without affecting customer experience
- **Metrics**: Model accuracy, prediction latency, data quality
- **Success**: Clean logs, no errors, predictions look reasonable

### Phase 2: 10% Canary (Week 2)
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  $API_URL/api/feature-flags/rollout/canary
```
- **Goal**: Route 10% of traffic to AI with full monitoring
- **Metrics**: p95 latency <300ms, error rate <0.5%, no profit loss
- **Success**: SLA maintained, customer satisfaction stable

### Phase 3: 50% Partial Rollout (Week 3)
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  $API_URL/api/feature-flags/rollout/partial
```
- **Goal**: Scale to 50% traffic with confidence
- **Metrics**: All SLA metrics green, profit margins maintained
- **Success**: Business metrics improved vs control

### Phase 4: 100% Full Production (Week 4)
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  $API_URL/api/feature-flags/rollout/full
```
- **Goal**: Full production AI bargaining for all users
- **Metrics**: System stable, customer experience improved
- **Success**: Project complete, AI system delivering value

## Emergency Procedures

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  $API_URL/api/feature-flags/rollout/rollback
```

### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Set traffic to 0
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"flag": "AI_TRAFFIC", "value": 0.0}' \
  $API_URL/api/feature-flags/set

# Enable shadow mode for diagnosis
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"flag": "AI_SHADOW", "value": true}' \
  $API_URL/api/feature-flags/set
```
