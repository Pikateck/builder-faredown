git commit -m "P0: Complete Postgres Integration - Frontend + Admin wiring"
git push origin main
```
- [ ] Code pushed successfully

```

Expected tables:
- [ ] customers
- [ ] pan_identifiers
- [ ] special_requests
- [ ] booking_documents

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'customers' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

- [ ] All expected columns present

- [ ] Constraints properly applied

### Step 4: Test API Endpoints

```bash
# Test 1: Health Check
curl https://builder-faredown-pricing.onrender.com/api/v1/bookings/health

# Expected: {"success": true, "status": "healthy", "database": "connected"}
- [ ] Health check passes

# Test 2: Create Booking
curl -X POST https://builder-faredown-pricing.onrender.com/api/v1/bookings/hotels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer": {"email": "test@faredown.com", "firstName": "Test", "lastName": "User", "phone": "+91-9999999999"},
    "pan_number": "ABCDE1234F",
    "hotel": {"code": "HOT1", "name": "Test Hotel", "checkIn": "2025-04-15", "checkOut": "2025-04-20", "nights": 5, "rooms": 1, "adults": 2},
    "pricing": {"basePrice": 5000, "taxes": 500, "fees": 100, "total": 5600, "currency": "INR"},
    "specialRequests": "Test request"
  }'

# Expected: {"success": true, "data": {"bookingId": "UUID", "bookingRef": "FD...", ...}}
- [ ] Booking created successfully
- [ ] bookingRef generated
- [ ] Response includes all expected fields

# Test 3: Verify in PgAdmin
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE email = 'test@faredown.com';
SELECT * FROM pan_identifiers WHERE customer_id = (SELECT id FROM customers WHERE email = 'test@faredown.com');
SELECT * FROM hotel_bookings WHERE customer_id = (SELECT id FROM customers WHERE email = 'test@faredown.com');
SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE entity_type = 'hotel_booking' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

- [ ] Customer record created
- [ ] PAN hashed (not plain text visible)
- [ ] Booking record created
- [ ] Audit log entry exists

# Test 4: Get Booking Details
curl https://builder-faredown-pricing.onrender.com/api/v1/bookings/hotels/FD202504051A2B3C

# Expected: {"success": true, "data": {...full booking details...}}
- [ ] Booking retrieval works
- [ ] All fields populated
- [ ] Related documents/requests returned

# Test 5: Admin Endpoints (requires auth token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  https://builder-faredown-pricing.onrender.com/api/v1/admin/bookings

- [ ] Admin list endpoint works
- [ ] Returns bookings list
- [ ] Pagination working

# Test 6: Dashboard Stats
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  https://builder-faredown-pricing.onrender.com/api/v1/admin/bookings/stats/dashboard

- [ ] Stats endpoint works
- [ ] Returns accurate numbers
```

### Step 5: Verify Audit Logging

```sql
-- Check recent audit logs
SELECT entity_type, action, user_email, status, created_at 
FROM audit_logs 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Should show entries for:
-- - hotel_booking creation (action: 'create')
-- - Any updates
-- - All with correct timestamps
```

- [ ] Audit logs being written
- [ ] All fields populated
- [ ] Timestamps correct

### Step 6: Test Data Integrity

```sql
-- Verify foreign keys working
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hotel_bookings WHERE customer_id IS NULL;  -- Should be 0 or very few

-- Verify PAN is hashed
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pan_identifiers WHERE pan_hash IS NOT NULL;  -- Should match PAN count

-- Verify masking
SELECT pan_last4, LENGTH(pan_hash) as hash_length 
FROM pan_identifiers LIMIT 5;
-- Should show: pan_last4 = 4 chars, pan_hash = 64 chars (SHA256)

-- Verify indexes
\di  -- List all indexes
```

- [ ] Foreign key relationships intact
- [ ] PAN hashing working
- [ ] Indexes created
- [ ] Data consistency verified

---

## üîí Security Verification

- [ ] **PAN Storage**
  - [ ] Plain PAN not stored anywhere
  - [ ] SHA256 hash used
  - [ ] pan_last4 field populated
  - [ ] Test query: `SELECT * FROM pan_identifiers WHERE pan_number IS NOT NULL;` returns 0 rows

- [ ] **Audit Logging**
  - [ ] All mutations logged
  - [ ] Old/new values captured
  - [ ] User info logged
  - [ ] Request ID tracked

- [ ] **Role-Based Access**

---

## üìä Performance Verification

```sql
-- Check indexes are created
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('customers', 'pan_identifiers', 'hotel_bookings', 'audit_logs')
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;

-- Should show indexes on:
-- - customers: email, loyalty_tier, kyc_verified
-- - pan_identifiers: customer_id, is_primary, is_verified, pan_hash
-- - hotel_bookings: customer_id, bargain_status
-- - audit_logs: entity, action, user_id, created_at, request_id
```

- [ ] All indexes created
- [ ] Query performance acceptable (< 100ms for common queries)
- [ ] No N+1 queries

## üìû Rollback Plan

If **No-Go** criteria not met:

```bash

-- Drop views
DROP VIEW booking_summary_v2;
DROP VIEW customer_loyalty_summary;

-- Disable triggers (optional)
ALTER TABLE hotel_bookings DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_audit_booking_changes;

# 3. If data issue:
-- Restore from backup
pg_restore -d faredown_booking_db backup.dump

# 4. Revert code
git revert HEAD  # Or checkout previous version

# 5. Investigate and re-deploy
```

- [ ] Have database backup before deployment
- [ ] Have rollback plan in place
- [ ] Can restore from backup if needed

---

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:

- [ ] Monitor audit logs for 24 hours
