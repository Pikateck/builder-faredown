## KEY FUNCTIONALITY IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Flight Search & Results

**Features:**

- Real-time flight search with multiple airlines
- Advanced filtering (price, time, airlines, stops)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Sort by price/duration
- Expandable fare options per flight

**Airlines Included:**

- Emirates (3 fare types: Eco Saver, Eco Flex, Eco Flexplus)
- Air India (2 fare types: Economy, Premium Economy)
- Indigo (2 fare types: Saver, Flexi)

### 2. AI Bargaining System

**Implementation:**

- Real-time price negotiation modal
- AI counter-offer generation algorithm
- 30-second offer expiry timer
- Price validation and used-price tracking
- Dynamic success/rejection logic based on discount amount

**Bargaining Logic:**

```javascript
// AI logic for counter offers
if (discountRequested <= 0.3) {
  // High chance of matching user's price (80%)
  return userPrice or slightly higher
} else if (discountRequested <= 0.5) {
  // Medium chance, counter with 70-80% of original
  return betterCounterOffer
} else {
  // Low chance, offer maximum 30% discount
  return maxDiscount
}
```

### 3. Mobile-First Design Patterns

**Booking.com Inspired Features:**

- Bottom sticky search bars
