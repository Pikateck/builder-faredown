# Git Setup and GitHub Push Instructions

## Current Issue

Your git repository is corrupted. Here's how to fix it and push to GitHub:

## Step 1: Fix Git Repository

Since the git repository is corrupted, you'll need to initialize a fresh repository:

```bash
# Remove corrupted git folder
rm -rf .git

# Initialize new git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - complete booking system"
```

## Step 2: Setup GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository
2. Copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repo-name.git)

## Step 3: Connect and Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: If you need authentication

```bash
# For HTTPS (you'll need a personal access token)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Use personal access token instead of password when prompted
```

## Alternative: Manual Backup Method

If git still doesn't work, you can manually backup your code:

1. **Download via Browser**: Many cloud IDEs allow you to download files/folders
2. **Copy-paste method**: Copy your important files to a local editor
3. **Use the backup files I've created for you**

## Important Files to Backup

- `/client/` - All React components and frontend code
- `/server/` - Backend API code
- `/shared/` - Shared utilities
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- `*.md` files - Documentation
- Configuration files (tailwind.config.ts, vite.config.ts, etc.)

## Current Project Structure

Your project contains:

- ✅ Complete booking system with calendar functionality
- ✅ Hotel details with working share buttons
- ✅ Pricing system without decimals
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ All components and pages

The code is ready for deployment and production use!
