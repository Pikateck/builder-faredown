## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Search Functionality Preserved:
- **Flights**: From/To cities, dates, trip types, passenger counts
- **Hotels**: Destination, check-in/out dates, rooms/guests
- **Sightseeing**: Destination and date selection  
- **Transfers**: Airport transfers and car rentals with locations/times

### URL Routing Maintained:
- Flights → `/flights/results`
- Hotels → `/hotels/results`
- Sightseeing → `/sightseeing/results`
- Transfers → `/transfer-results`

### Component Architecture:
```typescript
// Tab state management
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState("flights");

// Search form states for each module
const [tripType, setTripType] = useState("round-trip");
const [selectedFromCity, setSelectedFromCity] = useState("Mumbai");
const [hotelDestination, setHotelDestination] = useState("");
const [sightseeingDestination, setSightseeingDestination] = useState("");
const [transferMode, setTransferMode] = useState("airport");
```

- **Background**: White (`bg-white`)
- **Text**: Gray scale (`text-gray-900`, `text-gray-600`)

- **Section Headings**: `text-2xl font-bold`
- **Body Text**: `text-sm`, `text-lg` with appropriate opacity
