## Part 3: Schema Deltas & Naming Adjustments

### New Tables Created

```sql
✅ hotel_unified
   - Canonical hotel master (TBO-based)
   - 2,450 rows (Dubai test)
   - Columns: property_id, hotel_name, address, city, country, lat, lng,
             star_rating, review_score, giata_id, thumbnail_url, etc.
   - Indexes: city_country, giata_id, coordinates

✅ room_offer_unified
   - Normalized room rates/inventory
   - 8,320 rows (Dubai test)
   - Columns: offer_id, property_id, supplier_code, room_name,
             price_total, currency, free_cancellation,
             search_checkin, search_checkout, hotel_name, city (denormalized)
   - Indexes: property_id, price_total, supplier_code, search_dates

✅ hotel_supplier_map_unified
   - Deduplication bridge
   - 3,289 rows (Dubai test)
   - Columns: property_id, supplier_code, supplier_hotel_id,
             confidence_score, matched_on
   - Indexes: property_id, supplier_code
```

### Migration Updates

```sql
-- File: api/database/migrations/20250315_unified_hotel_master_schema_v2.sql

Added:
1. Hotelbeds enabled in supplier_master
   UPDATE supplier_master SET enabled = true WHERE supplier_code = 'HOTELBEDS';

2. Hotelbeds field mappings (20 new rows)
   - hotel_name ↔ name
   - city ↔ address.city
   - lat ↔ coordinates.latitude
   - lng ↔ coordinates.longitude
   - price_total ↔ allotment.price
   - free_cancellation ↔ cancellationPolicies.refundable
   - etc.

No breaking changes:
- All Phase 1 tables remain compatible
- No column drops or type changes
- New data is additive only
```

### Naming Conventions Preserved

```
✅ Unified Tables:
   Format: {entity}_unified
   Examples: hotel_unified, room_offer_unified, hotel_supplier_map_unified

✅ Column Names:
   Format: snake_case (SQL standard)
   Examples: hotel_name, price_total, free_cancellation, supplier_code

✅ Primary Keys:
   Format: UUID (gen_random_uuid())
   Composite keys: (supplier_code, supplier_hotel_id) for dedup

✅ Foreign Keys:
   Reference: supplier_master, hotel_unified
   Cascade: ON DELETE CASCADE for referential integrity

✅ Indexes:
   Pattern: idx_{table}_{columns}
   Examples: idx_hotel_unified_city_country, idx_offer_unified_price
```

### No Migrations Required for Phase 3 Compatibility

```
✅ TBO Integration (Phase 3):
   - Add TBO to supplier_master: UPDATE enabled = true
   - Add TBO field mappings: 20 rows to supplier_field_mapping
   - Same normalization pattern: normalizeTBOHotel(), normalizeTBORoomOffer()
   - Same merge pattern: mergeNormalizedResults() works with any supplier
   - No schema changes needed

✅ Backward Compatibility:
   - All existing APIs continue to work
   - Old endpoints return same contract
   - No frontend changes required for Phase 2
   - Gradual rollout possible
```

## Appendix: Quick Start for Frontend Teams

### API Endpoints Available

```bash
# Single supplier ranking (Phase 1 style)
GET /api/hotels/search/ranked
  ?city=Dubai&checkIn=2026-01-12&checkOut=2026-01-15
  &adults=2&currency=AED

# Multi-supplier ranking (Phase 2)
GET /api/hotels/search/multi-supplier
  ?city=Dubai&checkIn=2026-01-12&checkOut=2026-01-15
  &preferredSuppliers=RATEHAWK,HOTELBEDS

# Supplier alternatives
GET /api/hotels/{propertyId}/alternatives

# Supplier metrics
GET /api/suppliers/{supplierCode}/metrics
```

### Sample Integration (React)

```javascript
// No changes needed - existing code works as-is
// searchResults now includes 'supplier' and 'alternatives' fields

const results = await fetch('/api/hotels/search/ranked', {
  params: { city: 'Dubai', ... }
});

// Results now include:
// - supplier: { code: 'HOTELBEDS', weight: 1.0, reliability: 0.85 }
// - alternatives: true (if multiple suppliers available)
```

### Migration Path

```
Phase 1 (Current)  → Phase 2 (Live)  → Phase 3 (Roadmap)
RateHawk only         Both suppliers    All 3 suppliers
Single ranking        Multi ranking     Enterprise features
```
