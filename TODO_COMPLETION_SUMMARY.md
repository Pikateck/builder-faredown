### 6. Admin Panel Data Verification
**Status:** 🔄 PENDING (Requires live deployment)

**Note:** Code is in place, but live testing requires:
1. Deployed environment
2. Live user signups
3. Real booking transactions

---

### 7. Evidence Collection Infrastructure
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Created Files:**
1. **`api/scripts/collect-evidence.js`** - Automated evidence collection script
2. **`api/routes/admin-users-verify.js`** - API endpoint for verification
3. **`audits/2025-10-08/README.md`** - Documentation

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd api
node scripts/collect-evidence.js
```

**Generated Evidence Files:**
- `01_users_last3.csv` - User records
- `02_bookings_samples.csv` - Booking records  
- `03_payments_samples.csv` - Payment transactions
- `04_invoices_samples.csv` - Voucher records
- `05_admin_summary.csv` - Admin dashboard summary
- `final_acceptance.csv` - Final acceptance SQL results

## 📋 Implementation Tracker Updated

The `BUILDER_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` has been updated with:
- ✅ All code verifications marked complete
- 📝 Evidence collection scripts ready
- 🔄 Admin panel testing pending live deployment

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Live Environment:
1. Deploy the updated code to production
2. Test user registration flow
3. Run evidence collection script:
   ```bash
   cd api
   node scripts/collect-evidence.js
   ```
4. Verify admin panel displays live data
5. Collect UI screenshots for final evidence package

### Quick Verification Commands:
```bash
# Check users table
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"

# Check bookings table  
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hotel_bookings;"

# Check payments table
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments;"

# Check vouchers table
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vouchers;"
