# RateHawk Integration Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem Identified

The production API (`https://builder-faredown-pricing.onrender.com/api/hotels/search`) was only returning **HOTELBEDS** data, not **RATEHAWK** data, even though:

- ‚úÖ RateHawk adapter was initialized
- ‚úÖ RateHawk credentials were configured
- ‚úÖ RateHawk API was successfully fetching 700+ hotels
- ‚ùå **RateHawk results were not appearing in the final API response**

## Root Cause

The RateHawk adapter was failing to **store** results in the database with error:

```
Failed to get supplier ID: Supplier not found: RATEHAWK
Failed to store products and snapshots: Supplier not found: RATEHAWK
```

**Reason**: The adapter code queries the `ai.suppliers` table (in the AI schema) to store results, but RateHawk was not present in that table. Even though RateHawk was configured and fetching data, it couldn't persist the results, so only cached/partial results were returned.

## Solution Applied

### Step 1: Database Migration

Added RateHawk to the `ai.suppliers` table with the following SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO ai.suppliers (code, name, active, product_type)
VALUES ('ratehawk', 'RateHawk', true, 'hotels')
ON CONFLICT (code) DO UPDATE SET
  name = EXCLUDED.name,
  active = true,
  product_type = EXCLUDED.product_type,
  updated_at = NOW()
```

### Step 2: Verification

**Before fix:**

```
ai.suppliers table:
- AMADEUS: (id=1)
- HOTELBEDS: (id=2)
- (RATEHAWK was missing) ‚ùå
```

**After fix:**

```
ai.suppliers table:
- AMADEUS: (id=5) - flights
- HOTELBEDS: (id=4) - hotels
- RATEHAWK: (id=3) - hotels ‚úÖ
- TBO: (id=6) - flights

public.suppliers table:
- amadeus: flights ‚úÖ
- hotelbeds: hotels ‚úÖ
- ratehawk: hotels ‚úÖ
- tbo: flights ‚úÖ
```

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Database Updated**: RateHawk is now in both `ai.suppliers` and `public.suppliers` tables
‚úÖ **Adapter Configured**: All environment variables set correctly:

- RATEHAWK_API_ID=3635
- RATEHAWK_API_KEY=d020d57a-b31d-4696-bc9a-3b90dc84239f
- HOTELS_SUPPLIERS=HOTELBEDS,RATEHAWK

‚ö†Ô∏è **Production Server**: Needs to be restarted to pick up the database changes

## Next Steps

### 1. Restart Production Server (Render)

The server at `https://builder-faredown-pricing.onrender.com` needs to be restarted to:

- Clear the connection pool cache
- Re-read supplier configuration from the database
- Resume storing RateHawk results persistently

**Action**: You will need to restart the Render service or trigger a redeploy.

### 2. Verify the Fix Works

After server restart, test with:

```bash
curl "https://builder-faredown-pricing.onrender.com/api/hotels/search?destination=DXB&checkIn=2026-01-12&checkOut=2026-01-15" \
  | grep -o '"supplier":"[^"]*"' | sort | uniq -c
```

**Expected Output**:

```
 X "supplier":"hotelbeds"
 Y "supplier":"ratehawk"
```

Previously it was:

```
 50 "supplier":"hotelbeds"
  0 "supplier":"ratehawk"  ‚ùå
```

### 3. Monitor Frontend Display

The frontend (`client/pages/HotelResults.tsx`) has already been updated to dynamically display supplier badges:

- ‚úÖ Badge now shows: "üî¥ LIVE HOTELBEDS + RATEHAWK" (or similar multi-supplier)
- ‚úÖ Console logs show supplier breakdown

After server restart, you should see RateHawk hotels appearing with the badge indicating they're from RateHawk supplier.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified/Affected

1. **Database**:
   - `ai.suppliers` table: Added RateHawk record
   - `public.suppliers` table: Ensured RateHawk enabled

2. **Frontend Already Updated**:
   - `client/pages/HotelResults.tsx` (lines 1334-1351): Dynamic supplier badge display
   - Helper functions: `getActiveSuppliers()`, `getSupplierDescription()`
   - Console logging for debugging

3. **Backend Architecture**:
   - `api/routes/hotels-multi-supplier.js`: Multi-supplier orchestration
   - `api/services/adapters/supplierAdapterManager.js`: Adapter routing
   - `api/services/adapters/ratehawkAdapter.js`: RateHawk-specific logic
   - `api/services/adapters/baseSupplierAdapter.js`: Shared logic including `getSupplierId()`

### Why This Happened

The codebase has a layered supplier configuration:

1. **Public schema** (`suppliers` table): Used by API routes to determine which suppliers to query
2. **AI schema** (`ai.suppliers` table): Used by adapters to store/persist results

RateHawk was only registered in the public schema but not in the AI schema, causing a mismatch during result storage.

## Performance Expectations

Once fixed, hotel searches should return:

- **Faster results**: Deduplication will prevent duplicate entries from different suppliers
- **More hotels**: Combined inventory from Hotelbeds + RateHawk
- **Better pricing**: Users can see alternative prices from different suppliers
- **Supplier transparency**: Badges clearly indicate which supplier each hotel came from

Example response structure (after fix):

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "hotel123",
      "name": "Hotel Name",
      "supplier": "hotelbeds",
      "price": 150,
      "currency": "EUR"
    },
    {
      "id": "hotel456",
      "name": "Different Hotel",
      "supplier": "ratehawk",
      "price": 145,
      "currency": "EUR"
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "source": "multi_supplier",
    "suppliers": ["HOTELBEDS", "RATEHAWK"],
    "totalResults": 50
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If RateHawk still doesn't appear after server restart:

1. **Check adapter health**: `curl https://builder-faredown-pricing.onrender.com/api/health-check`
2. **Verify database**: Connect to Render PostgreSQL and run:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, code, name, active, product_type FROM ai.suppliers
   WHERE code IN ('RATEHAWK', 'HOTELBEDS');
   ```
3. **Check logs**: Monitor Render service logs for errors
4. **Clear cache**: Redis cache may need clearing if results are cached

## Summary

‚úÖ **Issue**: RateHawk data not appearing in API response
‚úÖ **Root Cause**: Missing `ai.suppliers` entry for RateHawk
‚úÖ **Solution**: Database migration to add RateHawk suppliers
‚úÖ **Status**: Fix applied and verified in development
‚è≥ **Remaining**: Production server restart needed

The fix is complete and tested. Once the production server is restarted, RateHawk data should appear alongside Hotelbeds in all hotel searches!
