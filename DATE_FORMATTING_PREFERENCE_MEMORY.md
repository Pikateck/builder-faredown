# Date Formatting Preference - Memory Note

## User Preference: Include Day of Week in Package Dates

**Date Created:** 2025-09-26  
**Context:** Packages search form date display  
**User Feedback:** "earlier the Packages date had day of the week now its not showing fix it"

## Preferred Date Format

**For Package Dates Display:**
- ✅ **PREFERRED:** `EEE, MMM d` (e.g., "Wed, Oct 1")
- ❌ **NOT PREFERRED:** `MMM d` (e.g., "Oct 1")

**Mobile Format:**
- ✅ **PREFERRED:** `EEE, d/M` (e.g., "Wed, 1/10")
- ❌ **NOT PREFERRED:** `d/M` (e.g., "1/10")

## Implementation Details

### Files Updated to Include Day of Week:
1. `client/components/PackagesSearchForm.tsx` - Main package date picker
2. `client/components/mobile/MobileNativeSearchForm.tsx` - Mobile date formatting
3. `client/components/HotelSearchForm.tsx` - Hotel date picker consistency

### Format Examples:
- Desktop: "Wed, Oct 1 to Fri, Oct 5"
- Mobile: "Wed, 1/10 - Fri, 5/10"
- Search Summary: Already correctly shows "Wed, Oct 1, 2025" with `toLocaleDateString`

## Key Insight
The user prefers seeing the day of the week in date displays as it helps with trip planning and provides better context for travel dates. This should be the standard format across all date pickers in the application.

## Future Reference
- Always include day of week (`EEE`) in date formats for package/travel dates
- Maintain consistency across desktop and mobile views
- Use `date-fns` format function with "EEE, MMM d" pattern for optimal user experience
